# Water quality is something really important to, well, anyone and this project aimed to provide information to a wide audience about just that.




## This project was one of my favorites and it was definetly not easy, simple or straightforward. 


To begin, finding the data was not an easy task. For some parts of this project, I had to read over files so old they were almost illegible so I had to do that by hand. 

I collected data from various sources 

I created a dashboard  which can be found here:

Going to look over a bunch of data in a data set of my choosing and visualize the data. 
Going to use https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/water-quality-data-0de37
