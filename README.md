# Water quality is something really important to, well, anyone and this project aimed to provide information to a wide audience about just that.

Clean water is an important and vital resource for everyone.
The DWR takes samples of drinking water, ground water and other sources. And tests it for safety and 
quality. Where and how often is this testing taking place? 
Is there less now in some counties than in others?
While on the surface this data set seems mundane, in reality it contained a huge amount of depth 
with mountains of useful information just waiting to be parsed and shared. It was a great data set to get people talking and thinking. 
My goals for this presentation were to provide information in a way that was clear and hopefully easy to understand. 
To get people to ask questions and think about what goes on around them.
I wanted to visualize the numbers of stations over the course of some amount of time. And make comparisons between different counties.


## This project was one of my favorites and it was definetly not easy, simple or straightforward. 


To begin, finding the data was not an easy task. For some parts of this project, I had to read over files so old they were almost illegible so I had to do that by hand. 

I collected data from various sources, cleaned and compiled it and then built my app. 

I created a dashboard  which can be found here:

Going to look over a bunch of data in a data set of my choosing and visualize the data. 
Going to use https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/water-quality-data-0de37
